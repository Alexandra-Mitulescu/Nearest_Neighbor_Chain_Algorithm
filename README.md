# Nearest_Neighbor_Chain_Algorithm

The Nearest Neighbor Chain Algorithm is a cluster analysis technique that enhances various agglomerative hierarchical clustering methods. 
It offers a way to efficiently generate a hierarchy of point clusters by merging pairs of smaller clusters into larger clusters. 
This algorithm is compatible with clustering methods such as Ward's technique, complete-linkage clustering, and single-linkage clustering.

Please refer to the associated documentation for a more detailed understanding of the Nearest Neighbor Chain Algorithm and its application in hierarchical clustering methods.
